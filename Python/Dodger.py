#This program is meant to show how someone can dodge an authentication filter on a network
#It will change the hostname of the computer to convince the network that it is a diffrent computer from before
#This program is meant to be run before macchanger because hostname alterations require the computer to be restarted to take effect
#This program is for educational purposes only and should not be used with maliciuos intent
